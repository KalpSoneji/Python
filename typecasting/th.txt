2 types of type casting:

1. Implicit type casting: This type of casting is done automatically by the compiler. 
2. Explicit type casting: This type of casting is done manually by the programmer.

There are 2 types of explicit type casting:

1. Narrow casting: This type of casting is done when a larger data type is converted to a smaller data type. 
for ex: float can't be converted to int coz it loses its value.

2. Broader casting: This type of casting is done when a smaller data type is converted to a larger data type.
for ex: int can be converted to float coz it doesn't lose its value.
