there are 5 data types in python:
1. Integers
2. float
3. boolean
4. nonetype
5. string

there are 3 conditional statements in python:
1. if
2. elif
3. else

it has match case instead of switch case

it has a for loop and a while loop

for i in range(start, end, increment/decrement):    
    # code to be executed

to iterate through whole variable, for i in range(len(variable)): 
to iterate through whole variable reversed, for i in range(len(variable) - 1, -1, -1): 

for i in variable:
    # code to be executed

there are 3 types of operators:

1. unary (not present in python)
2. binary
3. ternary

there are 7 types of operators in python:

1. arithmetic: + - * / % // **
2. comparison: < > <= >= == !=
3. logical: and or not
4. assignment: += -= *= /= %= //= **=
5. bitwise: & | ^ ~ << >>
6. membership: in not in
7. identity: is is not

strings are immutable, no operation can be performed once it is declared

len(variable)

variable.upper() converts to uppercase
variable.lower() converts to lowercase
variable.title() makes every word's 1st character uppercase
variable.capitalize() makes 1st character of string uppercase
variable.swapcase() swaps case of string's each character

variable.lstrip() removes whitespaces from left side of the string
variable.rstrip() removes whitespaces from right side of the string
variable.strip() removes whitespaces from both sides of the string

there are 4 types of data structures in python:
1. lists
2. tuples
3. sets
4. dictionaries

lists:


data type of list is list
syntax: variable = [value1, value2, value3, ...]

features:

1. dynamic
2. heterogeneous
3. ordered
4. mutable
5. indexed
6. allows duplicate elements
7. iterable
8. subscriptable

list.append(value) adds value at the end of the list
list.insert(index, value) adds value at the specified index and pushes the other values forward
list.extend(list/string) adds all elements of the list to the current list, (takes any argument that is iterable)

list.pop() removes the last element from the list
list.pop(index) removes the element at the specified index
list.remove(value) removes the first occurrence of value

list.reverse() reverses the list
list.count(value) returns the number of occurrences of value
list.index(value) returns the index of the first occurrence of value
list.copy() returns a copy of the list

list.sort() sorts the list in ascending order
list.sort(key=len) sorts the list based on the length of the elements
list.sort(reverse=True) sorts the list in descending order
list.sort(key=len, reverse=True) sorts the list based on the length of the elements in descending order

list.clear() removes all elements from the list
